# API Implementation Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve TypeScript and runtime errors in the CIL CBT App frontend application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing API Exports**
   - Added missing `sectionsAPI` and `subsectionsAPI` implementations in `services/api.ts`
   - Fixed import statements in `PaperManagement.tsx`

2. **Recharts Import Issues**
   - Added missing `Pie` component import from recharts in `PerformanceDashboard.tsx`

## Implementation Details

### API Services Implementation

The following API services were added to `services/api.ts`:

1. **sectionsAPI**
   - `getSectionsByPaperId`: Retrieves all sections for a specific paper
   - `createSection`: Creates a new section
   - `updateSection`: Updates an existing section
   - `deleteSection`: Deletes a section

2. **subsectionsAPI**
   - `getSubsections`: Retrieves all subsections for a specific section
   - `createSubsection`: Creates a new subsection
   - `updateSubsection`: Updates an existing subsection
   - `deleteSubsection`: Deletes a subsection

All API services include proper error handling and fallback to mock data in development mode.

### Component Fixes

1. **PaperManagement.tsx**
   - Updated import statement to include `sectionsAPI` and `subsectionsAPI`
   - Fixed section and subsection edit functionality

2. **PerformanceDashboard.tsx**
   - Added missing `Pie` component to recharts imports
   - Ensured all chart components have proper TypeScript type definitions

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Type Safety**
   - All API methods properly annotated with TypeScript types
   - Function parameters and return types explicitly defined
   - Error handling with appropriate type assertions

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Fallback mechanisms for development mode
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Code Organization**
   - API services grouped logically by domain (papers, sections, subsections)
   - Consistent method naming convention across API services
   - Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all API methods

## Additional Notes

- The recharts library is already installed and available in the project (version 2.15.3)
- Mock data is provided for development environments to facilitate testing without backend dependencies
- All implementations follow the existing patterns used in the codebase to maintain consistency

## Verification

All TypeScript compiler errors have been resolved. The components should now function as expected with proper API integrations.
